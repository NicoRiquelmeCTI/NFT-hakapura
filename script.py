From the data collected on their symptoms of addiction to digital devices and climate anxiety, an AI model was used to interpret and encode them in the work painted by the artist from Easter, Tauroa, thus generating the image you see. The input used was:
                {self.description}.  
                This work is part of the Hakapura collection, a project promoted by the Chilean Kamanau Foundation in order to make visible the vulnerabilities of children's digital awareness. In this sense, for this collection a new smart contract format was innovated to promote the use of NFTs in philanthropic and social campaigns, so that by purchasing this digital object, its owner will be donating 90% of its profit to the cause. Funds will be distributed among the artists, a youth organization on the island and the foundation.
                If you buy this NFT, you will become a Mataroa (navigator in the Easter language) and you will be invited to participate in our community to contribute to the co-creation of recommendations for the proper use of new technologies. In addition, if you help us continue to raise funds for the cause by reselling your NFT, you will receive a second NFT to be part of our community of ambassadors for life. 
                So, how important to you is the protection of children's digital awareness? It's time to put your cryptocurrencies into action!""",
