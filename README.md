# NFT Hakapura

What is the impact that Hyperconnection has on the lives of young people? It is the question that motivated the creation of this collection that mixes science, art and technology to promote a social cause as important as the protection of children's digital awareness. On this occasion, the Kamanau Foundation interviewed 12 young people from Easter Island, to measure symptoms of addiction to digital devices and climate anxiety factors; data that was later processed by Artificial Intelligence to merge them with the works of two outstanding plastic artists from RapaNui. In this way, the first artistic and philanthropic collection of the Kamanau Foundation is born, which has a total issue of 30 NFTs.
